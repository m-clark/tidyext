This package takes some data processing functions originally found in
[lazerhawk](https://github.com/m-clark/lazerhawk), extending the
functionality of the tidyverse. For folks that do a lot of data
processing in that world, these make a handful of those very common
tasks a bit easier, and with an eye toward clean presentation and
visualization.

As these functions are more universally useful, especially to my
colleagues and friends who use R, putting them as their own thing will
perhaps make the functionality easier to use for them. Also, as
everything is programmed with the tidyverse, these functions are easily
customizable. The goal is more or less for this to depend on nothing one
wouldn’t have already with base R and the tidyverse package loaded.

Installation
------------

The usual GitHub installation. **devtools** package required.

``` r
devtools::install_github('m-clark/tidyext')
```

Functions
---------

### cat\_by

A quick summarize for categorical variables, possibly with
dplyr::group\_by, that provides frequencies and percentages of
categories.

### combn\_2\_col

Takes a column with multiple entries per cell and creates indicator
columns of all possible combinations of the cell values up to m
combinations.

### create\_prediction\_data

Straightforward way to quickly create data to make model predictions.

### describe\_all

A summary function for mixed data types that provides the information I
usually want.

### num\_by

A quick summarize, possibly with dplyr::group\_by, that provides things
like mean, sd, etc.

### num\_summary

A little better than summary.

### onehot

A function for one-hot encoding with a few helpful options.

### pre\_process

Easily pre-process a data set with common operations.

### sum\_NA, sum\_NaN, sum\_blank

Understand your nothingness.
