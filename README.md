<br>

This package takes some data processing functions originally found in
[lazerhawk](https://github.com/m-clark/lazerhawk), extending the
functionality of the tidyverse. For folks that do a lot of data
processing in that world, these make a handful of those very common
tasks a bit easier, and with an eye toward eventual tidy/clean
presentation and visualization with tools like kableExtra and ggplot2.

As these functions are more universally useful, especially to my
colleagues and friends who use R, putting them as their own package with
few dependencies will perhaps make it easier to use for them. The goal
is more or less for this to depend on nothing one wouldnâ€™t have already
with base R and the tidyverse package loaded. Also, as all the functions
use the tidyverse functionality, they are easily customizable.

Installation
------------

The usual GitHub installation. **devtools** package required.

``` r
devtools::install_github('m-clark/tidyext')
```

Functions
---------

### cat\_by

A quick summarize for categorical variables, possibly with
dplyr::group\_by, that provides frequencies and percentages of
categories.

### combn\_2\_col

Takes a column with multiple entries per cell and creates indicator
columns of all possible combinations of the cell values up to m
combinations.

### create\_prediction\_data

Straightforward way to quickly create data to make model predictions.

### describe\_all

A summary function for mixed data types that provides the information I
usually want.

### num\_by

A quick summarize, possibly with dplyr::group\_by, that provides things
like mean, sd, etc.

### num\_summary

A little better than summary.

### onehot

A function for one-hot encoding with a few helpful options.

### pre\_process

Easily pre-process a data set with common operations like
standardization, logging, etc.

### spread2

The tidyr spread without the duplicate row id problem.

### sum\_NA, sum\_NaN, sum\_blank

Understand your nothingness.
