\title{tidyext: Common data processing in the tidyverse.}
\description{
This package is a collection of functions that do the things I commonly need
to do with data. I work with data for myself and others everyday, and use
these functions quite often.  The goal here is to not have any dependencies beyond the tidyverse.
