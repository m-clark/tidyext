#' tidyext: Common data processing in the tidyverse.
#'
#' This package is a collection of functions that do the things I commonly need
#' to do with data. I work with data for myself and others everyday, and use
#' these functions quite often.  The goal here is to not have any dependencies beyond the tidyverse.
#'
#' To learn more about tidyext, you can browse the vignettes whenever they actually
#' get created some day: \code{browseVignettes(package = "tidyext")}
